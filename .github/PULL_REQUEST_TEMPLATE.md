Use a plain English sentence for the title. Listing closed PR titles for
a period should form a human-readable changelog.

Refer to issues related to the PR.

In related issues place checkmarks near items that should be considred
completed once the PR would be approved. If the PR doesn’t really solve
a particular item it’d be easy to uncheck it.
